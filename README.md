Curiosity is curated first by explaining the issue and understanding the trials and errors made by the current users. By listening first, mapping out the system enables me to easily identify any root causes. Together we hone in on ways to improve the process, analyzing collected data and creating how-to visuals of the preferred solution. Most importantly is inserting in some sort of feedback mechanism that allows for crowd sourced ideas for future concerns. In particular my policy areas of interests are : 
#### *Accessibility & Distribution    |  Neighborhood Revitalization*
